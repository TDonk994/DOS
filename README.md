This script is for educational purposes only.
I am not responsible for any damage caused by this script.
this is for testing your own network or someone else's network with PERMISSION.

these current attacks only work on WPA & WPA2 APs.




# future add-ons -- *If I have time/feel like it*
-more error checking
-the option to target multiple APs
-other types of attacks and packages
-clean up the script to function better 
-functions

this script assumes you have a wireless adapter with monitor mode and the correct drivers installed
if you don't at least have those this won't work.
might add a way to check later but unlikely

# requirements -- *what I could think of*
-Wireless Adapter or wireless card that can use monitor mode
-Linux *I think?*



# recommend -- *personal opinions* 
-use the Desktop dir *I like seeing things*
-use kali linux *tested script on this but any linux distro should work*
-newest version of kali linux
