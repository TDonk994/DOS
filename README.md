# WPA2-DOS
this script is for educational purposes only
I am not responsible for any damage caused by this script
this is for testing your own network or someone else's network with PERMISSION

    these current attacks only work on WPA & WPA2 APs.
    Currently don't have a way to make sure that the AP is real. Will probably add that later, so make sure you spell its name correctly.



# future add-ons -- *If I have time/feel like it*
    -more error checking
    -the option to target multiple APs
    -other type of attacks and packages
    -clean up the script to function better

this script assumes you have a wireless adapter with monitor mode and the correct drivers installed
if you don't atleast have those this won't work.
might add a way to check later but unlikly

# requirements -- *what I could think of*
    -Wireless Adapter or wireless card that can use monitor mode
    -Linux *I think?*



# recommend -- *personal opinions* 
    -use the Desktop dir *I like GUIs*
    -use kali linux *tested script on this but any linux distro should work*
    -newest version of kali linux
